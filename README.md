In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, I'm a passionate full-stack web developer who thrives on challenges and embraces innovation. With expertise in both traditional RESTful API and the latest GraphQL API, I seamlessly bridge the gap between front-end and back-end development. My weapon of choice for crafting captivating user interfaces is a blend of React, Redux, Bootstrap, Semantic UI, HTML, CSS, and SCSS. For robust back-end development, I rely on the power of MongoDB, Express, and NodeJS. My experience in deploying projects using MongoDB Atlas and Heroku ensures seamless integration and scalability.

Beyond web development, I'm an SEO and digital marketing expert with a knack for driving organic traffic and boosting brand visibility. My keen interest in machine learning fuels my exploration of its potential to transform industries and enhance user experiences.

Currently, I'm immersed in the world of SaaS product development, spearheading Invictosoft, my company dedicated to creating innovative business automation and digital presence solutions. With every project I undertake, I strive to push the boundaries of technology, empowering businesses to thrive in the digital age.
